<p>Many date validation programs do not take into account illegal dates such as 30th february and simply do a regex check. This is my answer to this frequent issue (nb: does not include the regex).</p>
<p>Simply splitting the component parts of the date, creating a new date object, and checking the day, month and year match the original is all that is required - as a js date object will automatically increment if an illegal value is entered. Eg. 32nd January will become 1st february - thus the date and month will no longer match. Simple :)</p>
<p>Enter a date in dd/mm/yyyy format:</p>
<input id="dateinput" />
<input type="submit" onClick="alert(validateDate(document.getElementById('dateinput').value))" value="Validate" />
